# 1
at lcms software you export the data in Excel file.
save as CSV file.


# 2
preper a table with unique compund names and their related pathway for your lcms data.

first, to merge your compund names with our library-file, use the function "merge_with_library"*.

than keep searching for outher compunds to fill your merged table (your new CSV file).
fill only compunds that interesting you - like HTs, flavonoids, lignins and outher shikimte-pathway-related metabolites.

in "papers" folder you can find two papers that can help you with compounds classification.

dont forget to add your new compound names and their related pathway to our library-file.
keep the names unique please.


# 3
prepare files for analysis in "metaboanalyst".
use the function "prepare_metabo_tables".

* to not remove files by mistake -  if you will create new file with the same name and path to old file, it will ask you if to continue

* all functions scripts are saved in "P:/pomegranate RNAseq 2022/lcms files/pipeline_script/"

* library-file
path and file name: "P:/pomegranate RNAseq 2022/lcms files/pom_library_updated.xlsx"
description: column_B is the compund-pathway-related name.
             column_C is outher description like HTs type and phenol type. (G=gallotannins, E=ellagitannins, EE=ellagitannins with ellagic acid core)

* run "merge_with_library"

to upload the function use the command:

### table.from.lcms.software
### raw data from lcms (excel file in csv format from lcms in Tel-Hai)
#     example: table.from.lcms.software = "P:/yonatan/RNAseq_yonatan_2021/lcms/data.from.lcms/All_Compounds_pom_T_060722.csv"
